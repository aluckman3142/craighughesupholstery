                        A Few Words From Mrs H:  Craig & I have worked alongside each other for 10 years, we try & achieve what people desire for their furniture! what's in there thoughts and project that onto the furniture.  It's all about their piece of furniture making them smile everyday when they see it.  I always advise clients not to rush so we work together to get it right as it is a lot of money to spend if you get it wrong!.  We are passionate about what we do and see each piece as a new challenge no two jobs are the same. We are successful at what we do but there is always room for those little jobs and everyone is welcome whatever they are trying to transform. We undertake restoration work, sympathetic repairs, traditional & Modern upholstery.
